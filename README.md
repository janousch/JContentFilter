# JContentFilter

## About

This plugin adds a filter to the content browser so that it shows inappropiate textures.
Unreal Engine 4 Content Filter for inappropiate textures. The filter will list all textures without a power of two and not marked as UI textures.

<br>     1.2 Clone from the master branch or delete the Binaries and Intermediate folder in /JContentFilter
<br>     1.3 Generate visual studio project files
<br>     1.4 Compile the solution
2. Open your project select the filter in the Content Browser: Filters -> Other Filters -> Inappropiate Textures
